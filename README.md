# ViT-UNet for Oil Spill Segmentation

This repository contains code for oil spill segmentation using a Vision Transformer-based U-Net (ViT-UNet) implemented in PyTorch. The model is designed for accurate segmentation of oil spills from satellite imagery.

**Features**:

- ViT-UNet Architecture: Combines Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones with U-Net architecture for robust segmentation.

- Evaluation Metrics: Includes functions to calculate IoU, precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

- Visualization: Tools for visualizing segmentation results and ground truth overlays.

**Requirements**

- Python >= 3.8

- PyTorch

- Albumentations

- OpenCV

- Segmentation Models PyTorch (segmentation-models-pytorch)

- Timm
